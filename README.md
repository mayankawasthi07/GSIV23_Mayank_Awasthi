# How to run the app

3 - Write `cd/GSIV23_Mayank_Awasthi` in the terminal.\

## Extra information

1 - I used Material UI for the responsive design so that it will get fit to all the screens.\
2 - I used material ui search library for the search bar and also material UI icons.\
3 - Movie image height and width in the card and also the font size was not clear to me as I was unable to find that in the assignment. So I adjusted the height and width according to my screen viewport.\
4 - I was only able to fetch 20 movies per page so I used pagination to render 10 more page with 20 images in each page. Also for search, only 20 movies was present and so I removed the pagination once you type something on the search bar.\
5 - I haven't designed pagination.\
